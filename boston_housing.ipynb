    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "* In general it's better to get more training points :\n",
    "  * -It depends on the project if the model needs more data to improve the accurcy ,if is not so it will be heavy to process and it depends on the available resources .\n",
    "  * -if the data was expensive it wouldn't be available to get more data .\n",
    "* -And Not Always. It depends on data quality and sometimes on data variety. More than “more data” I would say more different datasets.If you have more different between them datasets then you can make some data fusion and integrate the information to have better insights.It means that the value generated from integrating the different datasets is bigger than the sum of the different parts."

    "### Question 5 - Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."
   ]

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "* Yes , the model suffers from high bias and it's an underfiting at the maximum depth of 1 , Both training and validation scores are relatively low compared to other aras of the graph. This indicates that the model cannot explain the variance in the data no matter how you tweak it.\n",
    "* It will be found high variance and it is a sign of overfitting at the maximum depth of 10 , The training score is much higher than the validation score. In particular, the training score is higher that for every other value of max_depth. The validation score though is highest at a max_depth of around 4 to 5 and drops for larger values. This indicates that the model's variance is getting too big for these larger values.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " *Note*\n",
    " though that the standard deviations of the validation scores are larger than the differences in the validation scores across max_depth values for all 3 <= max_depth <= 10. Thus, the drop in validation scores for max_depth larger than 4 to 5 should be taken with a grain of salt.\n"

    "** Hint: ** Look at the graph above Question 5 and see where the validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model?

    "** Hint: ** When explaining the Grid Search technique, be sure to touch upon why it is used,  what the 'grid' entails and what the end goal of this method is. To solidify your answer, you can also give an example of a parameter in a model that can be optimized using this approach."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "* Grid-searching is the process of scanning the data to configure optimal parameters for a given model. Depending on the type of model utilized, certain parameters are necessary. Grid-searching doesn't only apply to one model type. Grid-searching can be applied across machine learning to calculate the best parameters to use for any given model. It is important to note that Grid-searching can be extremely computationally expensive and may take your machine quite a long time to run. Grid-Search will build a model on each parameter combination possible. It iterates through every parameter combination and stores a model for each combination. Without further ado.\n",

    "* Grid is commenly used to identify good model complexities and in fact, we applied it above in the task about the complexity curve. In that task, we did not know which value of max_depth is best for the decision tree applied to the Boston housing dataset. We defined a grid over the max_depth values (1, 2, ..., 10) and evaluated decision tree performance for each value from 1 to 10. This allowed us to estimate the relationship between max_depth and the scores. We used our knowledge of this relationship to choose a good value for max_depth by looking for a max_depth value for which increasing it does not improve the scores significantly anymore and It optimizes a learning algorithm by providing the best possible combination of parameters for the model, doing so by building and evaluating a model for each combination of algorithm parameters specified in a grid.\n"

    "* What is the k-fold cross-validation training technique? \n",
    "\n",
    "* What benefit does this technique provide for grid search when optimizing a model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** When explaining the k-fold cross validation technique, be sure to touch upon what 'k' is, how the dataset is split into different parts for training and testing and the number of times it is run based on the 'k' value.\n",
    "\n",
    "When thinking about how k-fold cross validation helps grid search, think about the main drawbacks of grid search which are hinged upon **using a particular subset of data for training or testing** and how k-fold cv could help alleviate that. You can refer to the [docs](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#cross-validation) for your answer."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "* Cross-validation is a statistical technique which involves partitioning the data into subsets, training the data on a subset and use the other subset to evaluate the model’s performance.and the k-fold cross-validation technique involves randomly dividing the dataset into k groups or folds of approximately equal size. The first fold is kept for testing and the model is trained on k-1 folds.The process is repeated K times and each time different fold or a different group of data points are used for validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The benefit k-fold cross-validation provides for grid search when optimising a model is that it is a hedge against overfitting, since it would allow you to grid search and cross-validate against multiple iterations of a train/test split, rather than just finding the optimal parameters for one train/test split."

    "### Implementation: Fitting a Model\n",
    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",
